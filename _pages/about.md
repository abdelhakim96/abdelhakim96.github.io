Ahoy! I'm an Industrial Ph.D. student at Aarhus University/EIVA in Denmark, on a mission to take underwater robotics to the next level. With my trusty algorithms and learning-based optimal control skills, I'm tackling the challenging waters of dynamics and control theory, optimization, and robotics.

Nothing thrills me more than developing cutting-edge algorithms for real-world robotic systems and testing them in the depths of the ocean. Whether it's finessing control strategies for a swarm of robotic fish, or optimizing the movement of an autonomous underwater vehicle, I'm always up for a challenge.

Join me on my quest to revolutionize underwater robotics and unleash the full potential of the ocean's depths.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
